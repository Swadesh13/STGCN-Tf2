# STGCN-Tf2

## Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains code updated for Tensorflow Version 2 from the original [repository](https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18).

Other than code conversion from TFv1 to TFv2, certain additional changes have been made in the data loading mechanism. This code runs slower than the original version. The inference is particularly not optimized for TFv2 performance.

For my project, the most updated code is present in another [repository](https://github.com/Swadesh13/Pollution-STGCN) that has additional changes and also, a number of added models to compare various combinations of Spatial-GCN and Temporal-GCN layers.
